# DiscoMon! Your destination for monster discover!

# Description

- The goal of DiscoMon is to be a single-page-application that enables the user to discover a handful of monsters and decide if they will "keep" or "release" the monster.
- A secret is teased with a "Have I found them all?" button, suggesting the user ought to attempt to collect all the monsters to see what will happen.

# Goals

- The goals of the DiscoMon project is to integrate a fetch GET request, a handful of eventListeners, and at least one iterative process to create a cohesive web app that is self-explanitory.

# Installation

- DiscoMon uses a db.json to simulate communication with a server. This is done using a "json server".
- Json server instructions link included below
- If you do not have "json server" installed on your machine, open your terminal and paste this command in and press enter:
- npm install -g json-server
- Wait for the process to complete on it's own. When it is finished, and you are ready to get your server running, paste this command into your terminal:
- json-server --watch db.json
- If the server is up and running as it ought to be it will look like the included image titled "json server startup" in the "images" folder
- With your json server running you will next need to fork and clone this project from it's github repository page. Go to COME BACK AND INSERT GITHUB URL, click the Fork button in the top right corner, then click the Code button, click the SSH button, click the copy button, then return to your terminal.
- After ensuring your terminal is looking at the correct location (wherever you decide you want to keep it) enter the command "git clone" and paste the url you copied from the SSH window. It should look something like this:
- git clone git@github.com:codifyamplify/phase-1-javascript-project-mode.git
- Make sure you change directory into the folder created by the git-clone step, then enter the command:
- code .
